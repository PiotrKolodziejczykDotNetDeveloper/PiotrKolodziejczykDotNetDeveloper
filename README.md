- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PiotrKolodziejczyk
I am a programmer with five years of experience in the IT industry, specializing in C# technology and the .NET platform.
I hold an engineering degree in Informatics and Econometrics, which I earned at the University of Computer Science and Economics in Cracow.
My programming journey began in 2017 when I started my studies.
In December 2019, I landed my first job at Media-press as a 'Junior .NET Developer'.
During my first two years, I supported internal users and developed and maintained software for data acquisition and parsing.
We gathered data from various external sources such as websites, FTP servers, and APIs. Thanks to this work, I understood regular expressions and techniques for extracting data from websites.
Later, I transitioned to the 'Backend' team, where I was promoted to 'Mid .NET Developer'.
In this team, I am responsible for maintaining and developing backend services, creating new REST API solutions and background workers, and migrating legacy services to modern .NET versions.
My responsibilities also include integrating applications in containerized environments such as Docker/Kubernetes,
working with Postgres SQL/MS SQL databases, deploying applications using CI/CD pipelines,
and collaborating with various technologies like Entity Framework, LLBLGEN, GIT, Rabbit, Kafka, Elasticsearch, Redis, Azure, Solr, and many others.
